<h1> About me </h1>
        
        <h1> My hometown </h1>
        <p> My hometown, Dalian is a coastal city which located in Northeast China. But because of the sea near Dalian, it has warmer weather than other Northeast cities, with cool sea wind in summer and warmer temperature in winter. The characteristic of Dalian is mainly about sea, we have seafood, aquarium, parks near the sea and beach. These elements turns Dalian into a partial tourism city, and attracted many tourists every year. Additionally, the port of Dalian has important role in military and economy. The history of Dalian the city is not long, but this land was developed long time ago, but it still has many places worth to go for example the junction of the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea, Japanese-Russian Prison, Hengshan Temple, etc. </p>

        <h1> My hobbies </h1>
        <h1> video games </h1>
        <p>  Probably every young person loves playing games. The game I like playing so far are mostly hard core, and I like souls like games the most. For example Dark Souls, Sekiro, Nioh. And I played FPS games like Hunt Showdown, Escape from Tarkov too. These games gives me confidence when I across some levels that are very difficult, and give me power when there are too many difficulties in my life. And I can say I am one of the best souls like game player in this school XD. </p>

        <h1> painting/photographing </h1>
        <p> photography/painting. I put these together because both of them are ways to record beautiful things and show them to other people. I like taking pictures of combination of nature and human creations, this creates a beauty of technology and nature. I also like painting, to make things in my head to come true. Creating beautiful art works make me feel meaningful and happy, it encourage me to be optimistic everyday. Just like gaming, doing art is another way to encourage myself. </p> <a href="https://jinshuoxing.wixsite.com/mysite"> This is my photography website </a>

        <h1> 5 favorite virtual character </h1>
        <h1> Solaire of Astora </h1>
        <p> The first warrior of sunlight, first appear in Dark Souls 1. He is the most reliable NPC that can defeat the bosses by himself, and helped players a lot. He wanted to find his own sun through his journey. But as story going on, he become the bright sun of every player. This character encourage me to be kind like Solaire, help others like a sun. <img src = E:/Uglywebsite/solaire.jfif height = "200px" > </p>
        <h1> Firekeeper </h1>
       <p> Firekeeper, she is the NPC in Dark Souls 3, and is the only NPC who will not harm player what ever happened. Firekeeper will help player through the whole story till the end. Unsurprisingly, she is the best woman in most Dark Souls players’ heart. <img src = E:/Uglywebsite/keeper.jfif height = "200px" > </p>
        <h1> Tyrion Lannister </h1>
        <p>Tyrion Lannister, the character in “a song of ice and fire”, which is considered as a bad character. But I think he is the most successfully shaped character in the book. Because his characteristics, that the God took his looking, he is a dwarf, but gives him a wise brain. He could make correct decision but less people really trust him, his story could be a single story other than the story of “Starks”. <img src = E:/Uglywebsite/tyrion.jpg height = "200px" > </p>
   <h1> Orbeck of Vinheim </h1>
        <p> Orbeck of Vinheim, another NPC in Dark Souls 3. A sorcerer, who teaches players magic skills in game. He had a sad story, the story between him and player is a successful tragedy with warm emotions. The game shows us the process of Orbeck became teacher and student relationship of player, and as game goes on, the relationship gets stronger, with some decisions and ending, this character is also one of the NPC player like the most. <img src = E:/Uglywebsite/orbeck.jpg height = "200px" > </p>
        <h1> Geralt of Rivia </h1>
        <p> Geralt of Rivia, main character of The Witcher games, a witcher with high sword skill and magic power. The story of The Witcher games creates this character with legendary background and events he experienced. And has a really amazing character shape through small events and big story in games <img src = E:/Uglywebsite/geralt.jfif height = "200px" > </p>
